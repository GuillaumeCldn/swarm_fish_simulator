## Scripts

### build_phase_diagram.py

This script runs simulations in parallel. 

FIXME: When running simulations  with defaults, unrecognized argument errors are systematically raised for `simu_phase_diagram_simple_sim.py` but the simulations seem to still run. There might also be a problem with the logs not being created.
